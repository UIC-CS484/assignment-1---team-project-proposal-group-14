                </ul>
                <ul>The reason why our team picked this topic is because we're all very passionate about sports. Also, when we talked about
                    using other topics such as weather, or covid none of us seemed motivated about if we stuck with doing something we weren't intereted in. So our grouped decided
                    on sticking to sports and we happen to come to a common ground where we all watched the National Football League.
